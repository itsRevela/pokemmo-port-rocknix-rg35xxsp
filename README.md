#### Controller Support Status
Controller mapping is currently being tested using gptokeyb2. However, not all builds of libSDL2-2.0.so.0 support analog stick input properly, which may limit functionality on some devices.

As an alternative, work is in progress to support the original gptokeyb, which is not affected by SDL2 stick issuesâ€”but it does not support keyboard simulation, which limits input emulation in other ways.
