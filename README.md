### Assigning Panfrost in Rocknix

To configure Rocknix to use the **Panfrost** driver, first ensure your device supports it and that it‚Äôs not the only available option. For example, the **Powkiddy RGB30** supports both **libMali (GLES 3.2)** and **Panfrost (GL 3.1/GLES 3.1)**, as shown [here](https://rocknix.org/devices/powkiddy/rgb30/#software).

To switch to the Panfrost driver:
![step 1](docs/1.jpg)
![step 2](docs/2.jpg)


### 1. Install the Port

Download pokemmo.zip Place the `.zip` into:  
`/PortMaster/autoinstall`

Launch **PortMaster**. It will automatically install the port.

---

### 2. Add Official PokeMMO Client Files

Go to the official PokeMMO website:  
[https://pokemmo.com/en/downloads/portable](https://pokemmo.com/en/downloads/portable)

Download the **portable version**, extract it, and copy these into:  
`/roms/ports/PokeMMO/`

- `PokeMMO.exe`  
- `data/` folder

‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure not to replace the existing shaders folder, as it contains optimized shaders.
Replacing them may negatively impact performance on low-end devices.

### 3. Add Required and Optional ROMs

To add the ROMs, place them inside the PokeMMO/roms folder and set the following values in `main.properties`:
~~~
client.roms.nds=roms/pokemon_black.nds  
client.roms.em=roms/pokemon_emerald.gba  
client.roms.fr=roms/pokemon_firered.gba  
client.roms.nds2=roms/pokemon_platinum.nds  
client.roms.nds3=roms/pokemon_heartgold.nds
~~~

**Required ROM:**  
- Pok√©mon Black or White (Version 1)

**Optional ROMs (enable more regions):**  
- Fire Red  
- Emerald  
- Platinum

### üéÆ Login Without Keyboard Input

If your device does not have a keyboard, you can try one of the following methods to log in:

#### üîß Option 1: PokeMMO/credentials.txt

Edit the file PokeMMO/credentials.txt with your login credentials.

#### üîß Option 2: Connect a Keyboard for First Login

Temporarily connect a physical keyboard (USB or Bluetooth), log in as usual, and make sure to check the **"Remember Me"** option.

#### üìù Option 3: Type Password in Username Field (thanks ddrsoul)

Type your password in the **username** field, then **copy and paste** it into the password field. This allows you to use system copy/paste functions even without a keyboard.

The game will now automatically log in when launched on PortMaster-compatible devices.
