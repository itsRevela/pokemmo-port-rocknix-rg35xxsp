### üéÆ Login Without Keyboard Input

If your device does not have a keyboard, you can try one of the following methods to log in:

#### üîß Option 1: Connect a Keyboard for First Login

Temporarily connect a physical keyboard (USB or Bluetooth), log in as usual, and make sure to check the **"Remember Me"** option.

#### üìù Option 2: Type Password in Username Field (thanks ddrsoul)

Type your password in the **username** field, then **copy and paste** it into the password field. This allows you to use system copy/paste functions even without a keyboard.

#### ‚úÖ Option 3: Autologin Using Saved Credentials (Testing)

1. Log in on your PC with the **"Remember Me"** option enabled.  
2. This will generate a file at:  
   `config/savedcredentials.properties`  
3. Copy that file to your PortMaster device at:  
   `/roms/ports/PokeMMO/config/`

The game will now automatically log in when launched on PortMaster-compatible devices.
