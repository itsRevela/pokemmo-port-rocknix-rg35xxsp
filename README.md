### üéÆ Login Without Keyboard Input

If your device does not have a keyboard, you can try one of the following methods to log in:

#### üîß Option 1: PokeMMO/credentials.txt

Edit the file PokeMMO/credentials.txt with your login credentials.

#### üîß Option 2: Connect a Keyboard for First Login

Temporarily connect a physical keyboard (USB or Bluetooth), log in as usual, and make sure to check the **"Remember Me"** option.

#### üìù Option 3: Type Password in Username Field (thanks ddrsoul)

Type your password in the **username** field, then **copy and paste** it into the password field. This allows you to use system copy/paste functions even without a keyboard.

The game will now automatically log in when launched on PortMaster-compatible devices.
